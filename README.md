This app is being created as part of the Udacity Android NanoDegree.
It uses 2 moviedb api's to pull the highest rated and most popular movies.
You can save them to your library to view when not online.

I used the Android architecture sample [todo‑mvp‑clean](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp-clean/),
as a way to learn and experiment with creating custom callbacks using interfaces.

I made use of a method of extracting the view by creating a viewFactory, learnt by Vasiliy Zukanov in his Udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/dependency-injection-in-android-with-dagger/)
on implementing dependency injection with Dagger2. 

To insert your own Api key from the moviedb go to the RemoteRepositoy class in the Data package.
